#Journal Entry #1
_First Steps_

Fabrikam's engineering team has very little experience with high-scale event-oriented systems. 
They want to make sure that they are [asking the right questions][orientation].
They also need to get a minimum viable product deployed.

For their [first milestone][milestone] they want to:
- Ingest events from simulated devices
- [Store all the events for later analytics][cold-storage]
- [Increase the scale until they match the targets for there first contract][increase-scale]

> TODO: finish populating the backlog related to the first milestone

> TODO: add the overlay diagram showing which portions of the planned logical architecture that are planning to build
